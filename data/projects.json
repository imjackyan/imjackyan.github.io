This year I've gotten quite familiar with JS and web dev, so I thought to make a game using these tools, and here it is~ <br/> This shoot em up game offers many design innovations that are not present in other shoot em ups. I have taken an inspiration from the game Path of Exile, so this shoot em up game has many flexibilities on how you can mix and match weapons and modifications to produce interesting effects with the way you attack.
